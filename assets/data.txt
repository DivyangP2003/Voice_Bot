—— BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS ——

❓ What’s your #1 superpower?
Answer:
I’d say my superpower is bridging gaps — between people, between systems, and between ideas. Whether it’s translating technical work for non-technical teams, integrating AI with real-world urban challenges, or leading large events with diverse volunteers, I naturally step into roles where connection is missing. I enjoy bringing clarity to complexity and helping others move forward with confidence.

❓ What are the top 3 areas you’d like to grow in?
Answer:
First, I want to sharpen my storytelling — turning technical insights into narratives that resonate with users, clients, or leadership.
Second, I’m working on becoming more strategic in how I prioritize and scale projects — thinking beyond the build to the bigger picture.
Third, I’d like to become more confident in navigating ambiguity, especially when stakes are high and outcomes are unclear. I’m learning to trust my judgment even when there’s no obvious answer.

❓ What misconception do your coworkers have about you?
Answer:
People sometimes assume that because I’m quiet in meetings, I’m not engaged — but I’m actually processing everything and thinking deeply. When I do speak, I like to make sure it adds value. Over time, teams learn that I may not be the loudest voice, but I’ll be one of the most dependable when action is needed.

❓ How do you push your boundaries and limits?
Answer:
I intentionally take on projects that feel just outside my comfort zone. For example, I once volunteered to present a technical solution to a government panel, even though I was nervous about public speaking. I prepared like crazy, sought feedback, and ended up not only delivering it well, but actually enjoying the process. For me, growth happens when discomfort meets commitment — and I try to lean into that combination regularly.


I’m someone who enjoys building things that make life easier — whether that’s a smart dashboard for city planners or a clean system to manage a showroom’s finances. I’ve led events with over 200 people and I like that balance.

People sometimes assume that because I’m quiet in meetings, I’m not engaged — but I’m actually processing everything and thinking deeply. When I do speak, I like to make sure it adds value. Over time, teams learn that I may not be the loudest voice, but I’ll be one of the most dependable when action is needed.

What energizes me is meaningful collaboration: solving problems in ways that feel real and not just theoretical. What drains me is working without feedback or clarity. I'm a planner, but also adaptable when the situation calls for it.

One of the habits that sets me apart is my tendency to reflect. After every project, I take time to review what worked, what didn’t, and how I can grow from it. It’s helped me stay grounded and keep improving.

I’d say my #1 strength is being a connector — I bridge gaps between people, teams, and technologies. My teammates often tell me I bring calm in chaos and structure in ambiguity.

I used to believe being productive meant saying yes to everything. Now I know focus is power. My biggest learning this year is that leadership isn’t about volume — it’s about clarity and empathy.

When conflicts happen, I bring people back to shared goals. I’ve facilitated alignment sessions that turned tension into teamwork.

Outside of work, I’m working on my storytelling — turning data into insight and insight into action. I want to grow into a role that blends strategy, engineering, and impact.

Success for me is not just personal achievement, but helping others rise. I hope the legacy I leave in any team is one of momentum, kindness, and meaningful progress.

SELF-AWARENESS & PERSONALITY
- One thing I'm most proud of is building strong cross-cultural relationships on international projects by aligning goals across time zones and communication styles.
- My best friend would describe me as: driven, thoughtful, and dependable.
- I'm energized by solving problems with purpose-driven teams. I'm drained by prolonged ambiguity without feedback or progress.
- People often misjudge my calm nature as passivity — but I speak clearly when it matters.
- A habit that sets me apart: I reflect intentionally after projects, capturing lessons and improving continuously.
- Success, to me, means growing while helping others grow — making impact without losing curiosity or integrity.
- A piece of feedback that stayed with me: “You simplify complexity, but remember others need time to catch up.” That shaped how I tailor communication.
- I used to value multitasking — now I value deep focus and time-blocking.

GROWTH & REFLECTION
-First, I want to sharpen my storytelling — turning technical insights into narratives that resonate with users, clients, or leadership.
Second, I’m working on becoming more strategic in how I prioritize and scale projects — thinking beyond the build to the bigger picture.
Third, I’d like to become more confident in navigating ambiguity, especially when stakes are high and outcomes are unclear. I’m learning to trust my judgment even when there’s no obvious answer.
- Biggest lesson: Growth isn’t always linear — lateral moves and stillness can spark breakthroughs.
- A failure I learned from: I underestimated alignment time with stakeholders — it taught me to clarify expectations early.
- I'm actively working on improving storytelling to bridge technical ideas and human impact.
- A personal goal: I’m learning a new language to build discipline and cultural empathy.
- A surprise for my past self: I actually enjoy public speaking now — I used to dread it.
- Stepped outside my comfort zone: I led a training session for 100+ attendees, practiced rigorously, and got great feedback.
- If I could redo something, I’d ask for mentorship earlier — leaders are often more willing than we think.
